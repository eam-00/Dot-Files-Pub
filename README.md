# Public Dot Files

My configuration dot files, taken mostly from the Thinkpad T60, while running either OpenBSD and/ or Debian.

My Xscreensaver setup ([larger image](Pics/DSCN0052.00.jpg)) that tries to add some beauty and coolness to the dreadful default look that it has out of the box.  
Actually, the configuration file that sets up things the way they look is the [~/.Xresources](https://github.com/eam-00/Dot-Files-Pub/blob/master/.Xresources) one.
